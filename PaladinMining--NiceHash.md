The platform also emphasizes security, providing users with **two-factor authentication (2FA)** and secure payment processing.

Another significant aspect of NiceHash is its commitment to **decentralization**. By allowing direct transactions between buyers and miners, it reduces the need for intermediaries, ensuring faster and more transparent earnings.
