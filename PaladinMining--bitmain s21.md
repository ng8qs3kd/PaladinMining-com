In the ever-evolving world of crypto mining, terms like "mining pool," "difficulty adjustment," and "hash war" play crucial roles. Miners often join mining pools to share resources and increase their chances of earning rewards. However, the difficulty adjustment ensures that the network remains secure and balanced. As miners continue to seek ways to enhance their earnings, strategies such as "cloud mining" and "staking" are becoming increasingly popular. These methods provide alternative routes for generating passive income in the blockchain ecosystem.
